Several bridges unite the two halves of one of the most interesting towns on the route of the Whitewashed Villages, in the heart of the the Ronda hills, only a few kilometres from the Costa del Sol. </p> <div id=\"text-hidden-1\"> <p> </p> <p> The so-called \u201c <strong> city of the castles </strong> \u201d stands on a natural vantage point defended at its most accessible point by a citadel. It still preserves its walls and the most important gates which gave access to the city. The Almoc\u00e1bar Gate (13th century) provided access to the south side of the town, the Carlos I Gate dates from the 16th century, while the Exijara Gate led to the Jewish quarter. <strong> The old citadel </strong> <span> </span> Outstanding in these walled surroundings is the Gothic-Renaissance construction of the church of Esp\u00edritu Santo, ordered to be built by Fernando the Catholic to commemorate the reconquest of Ronda. Another major religious work is <strong> Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor </strong> , where Arab and Christian features combine. On the site of an old Roman temple, the Arabs built the Main Mosque of Ronda in the 13th century. Preserved from this period are the mihrab arch, decorated with stucco, and the minaret, transformed into a belltower. In the following centuries, its interior was enriched with Renaissance and baroque decoration, as can be admired in its Main Chapel, choir and altars. The Mudejar style, with stucco and horseshoe arches, can be clearly seen in the San Sebasti\u00e1n minaret, later used for Christian worship. Another Muslim legacy are the Arab baths, on the banks of the river. They date from the 13th century and are very well preserved. <span> </span> The civil architecture of Ronda is reflected in its ancestral homes and aristocratic small palaces. The palaces of Mondrag\u00f3n and of the Marquis of Salvatierra, and the House of the Moor are some of the delightful examples to be enjoyed.

The Arab bridge was built in the 14th century and gave access to the Old Outskirts. The so-called old bridge is comprised of a single arch measuring some 10 metres across. But most emblematic of all is the <strong> New Bridge </strong> , a colossal feat of engineering which joins the neighbourhoods of Mercadillo and Ciudad. It dates from the 18th century and its foundations sit on the bottom of the ravine, at some points reaching 98 metres in height and 70 in length. <span> </span> The old City Hall, now the <strong> Parador de Turismo </strong> , stands on top of the cliff and is an exceptional place to relax and take in the views. Its chef prepares tasty local recipes such as stewed partridge, roast kid and almond soup. Among the desserts, Ronda's \"yemas\", honey pancakes and almond cheese are some of the suggestions. <span> </span> The Paseo de Blas Infante walk and the <strong> Viewpoint of the Catholic Monarchs </strong> , near the bullring (considered to be the oldest in Spain), are excellent spots to take in the landscape formed by the river Guadalev\u00edn. Outstanding in the most modern part of town is the church of Nuestro Padre Jes\u00fas and the Virgen de los Dolores Pavilion. The church is built in the Gothic style, with a prominent Renaissance belltower. The chapel of the Virgin, meanwhile, has an attractive series of mannerist sculptures which decorate its pillars. <span> </span> Ronda is lavishly decked out for its festivals, ideal occasions to come and enjoy this area. The <strong> Fiestas de Pedro Romero </strong> , with old-style bullfights and a flamenco festival, are a major event, as are Holy Week, the festivals in memory of the Christian reconquest and the Pilgrimage of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Cabeza. <span> </span> The whitewashed villages, of Arab origin, in the <strong> Ronda mountains </strong> combine popular architecture with striking natural surroundings. Other towns, however, are famous for their Phoenician ruins (Jimena de L\u00edbar) or Roman remains (Acinipo).

There we must point out a magnificent cloister, and the church, which has an extraordinary portico that dates from the 12th century, with interesting sculpted relieves that depict biblical scenes. In addition to the monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda de Ripoll, we must mention the the church of Sant Pere, from the 12th century, with pre-Romanesque elements, which presently houses the Ethnographic Museum. The town's main industry between the 16th and 18th centuries was the manufacture of nails and weaponry, and it got to be one of the most important gunsmith's centres in Europe. With the arrival of the railway, the textile industry gathered momentum, financial boost that it still maintains today. <span> </span> </p>"}

The cathedral, destroyed in the late 10th century, was rebuilt between 1053 and 1067, and continued to be remodelled in the 12th century. There we can admire the cloister, the sarcophagus of San Ram\u00f3n and the High Reredos. The old refectory was turned into the restaurant of the hostel that is now located there. <span> </span> Visitors are surprised that such a small town could house an Episcopal See of such great importance during its time, and still in our days, as it is considered to be a site of great artistic and historical interest. Only when we consider the historical context of the 10th century, with the creation of resistance groups to fight off the Arabs in the area of the Pyrenees, can we understand the reason why the cathedral was built. <span> </span> From this town we can take excursions to the nearby valleys of Bisecas and Ventanillo. <span> </span> </p>"}

On your return, there is nothing more gratifying than to delight at the seafood taken straight from the estuary, such as cockles, clams and oysters, which, along with salmon, trout and eels from the Eo, are the star ingredients of the local cuisine. Not forgetting the delicious sweets made by the nuns at the convent of Santa Clara. <span> </span> It is also a good idea to spare some time for As Catedrais, one of the most beautiful stretches of sand on the Galician coastline.
