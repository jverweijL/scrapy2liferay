Its historic relevance has left an important architectural legacy, some of which can be seen at its remarkable main square, or Plaza Mayor. This is the space where we find both the City Hall (17th century) and the Romanesque church of Asunci\u00f3n, which dates back to the 12th century, although it was later remodelled in the 16th and 17th centuries. Among civil structures, we must point out the palace of the Dukes of Granada. Near the city centre we can see the old Roman-Hispanic settlement of Valeria. Over this archaeological site, a medieval fortress was built, taking advantage of its strategic location on top of a hill, and on the banks of the Gritos river. The ancient Roman basilica was adapted to Visigothic rites, and later, it was turned into the church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Rotonda. We still can admire the layout of the streets, and the water supply system, which includes an aqueduct, three underground reservoirs, and a \"ninfeo\", or fountain. </p>"}
